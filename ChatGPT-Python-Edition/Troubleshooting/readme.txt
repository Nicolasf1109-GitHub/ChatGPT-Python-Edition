This folder will have fixes for the script.
The files below that correspond with the problem your having is the file you should run.
Migrate.bat= The script asking you to run "openai migrate" when you say something
Update: It looks like the openai migrate command is not supported on Windows at the moment. 
This error suggests that the migration process is designed to be run on a different operating system, and Windows might not be compatible with the migration CLI tool yet.
Try usng the WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and use this script or if you are actually on Linux, try running the script and if you have any issues, post it in the Issues tab.
(If you are on Linux or using WSL, do not run the .bat file, run the .sh file instead.

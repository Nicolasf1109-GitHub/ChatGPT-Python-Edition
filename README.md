This is basically just ChatGPT in Python in a command line, you need your own API key and the model you are going to use in the script, if you want to edit those, read the lines below.

API Key: openai.api_key = "Insert your API key here"
Model: model="Insert model here", (You can change to other models, like 'gpt-3.5-turbo')
